;
; Below is a set of dummy word filter rules to be used with the zip file
; tests/word-filter-test-crawl.zip . A description of how to carry out this
; test is given there in the readme.txt file in this zip file.
; You should not use these rules on an actual web crawl or you will get very
; minimal results.
;
; The general format of this word filter rule set is a sequence of rule blocks:
; [some_url_or_domain1]
; rule_1
; rule_2
; ...
; [some_url_or_domain2]
;
; Anything on a line after a &#039;;&#039; is also treated as a comment.
; A rule block begins with a url or domain that the rules that follow it are
; to a apply to. urls and domains follow the site format as used in crawl
; options. For example, http:/somesite.com/sub_dir/file or domain:somewhere.com.
; A minus in front of this url can be used to indicate anything but that domain.
; For example, -domain:ca would mean anything but the ca domain.
; The rules given before any [some_url_or_domain] line are applied to ALL
; summaries. When a summaries is being processed, the set of applicable rule
; blocks is determined based on matching the summaries url with
; the rule block urls, then all rules from these blocks are applied. Here is
; an example set of rules which is roughly suitable to return only pages with
; Canadian content on Wikipedia:
; [domain:wikipedia.org]
; -canada,-canadian:NOPROCESS
;
; A filter rule is specified in a single line that contains a &#039;:&#039;
; All lines in a rule file without a &#039;:&#039; are treated as comments.
;
; A rule has the format:
; PRECONDITIONS:ACTIONS
; For example,
; surfboard#2,bikini#0.02,wave:NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW
; As one can see PRECONDITIONS and ACTIONS are comma separated lists where
; whitespace is ignored. A PRECONDITIONS list is said to hold if all of
; its constituent conditions hold. In which case, Yioop&#039;s page processor
; will perform each of the actions in the ACTIONS list.
; The condition surfboard#2 requires that the term surfboard occurred
; at least twice in the document. If the value after the # is
; between 0 and 1, such as in bikini#0.02, then the condition holds
; if occurrences of that term (no stemming) make up 0.02 percent of
; the documents total length. Finally, if the condition doesn&#039;t
; have a # in it, then it is satisfied if that term appears at all.
; The first character of a precondition can be a sign + or -. The
; condition +surfboard#2 is the same as surfboard#2; however,
; -surfboard#2 means the negation of the condition surfboard#2. That is,
; that surfboard appear in the document less than two times.
; If you want to check for the occurrence of a term like -5degrees in
; a document you can use the precondition +-5degrees.
;
; If all the conditions in a precondition hold then the  WordfilterPlugin
; applies the list of ACTIONS. Possible actions are
; NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOCACHE, NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR, NONE,
; JUSTFOLLOW, and NOPROCESS. These say how the summary
; of whole page should be processed and  most of them correspond to robot
; meta tag directives. We indicate here the non standard directives. The crawl
; makes use of the meta word info when performing indexing. In the case
; where the actions contain NOPROCESS the summary returned from
; pageSummaryProcessing will be false, and this will prevent
; any indexing of this document from occuring at all. This is different from
; NOINDEX which says the document should not show up in the index as search
; time. With NOPROCESS a info about page can show up in the index, if there was
; a link to the page which was processed. NOINDEX on the other hand checks at
; search time to eliminate such links. In the case where the
; actions contain JUSTFOLLOW, the document won&#039;t be stored in the index but
: links from it will be followed.
